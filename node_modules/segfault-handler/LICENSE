2) Additional non-binding clause (email me!)
If you reading this to vet the license for use in a product or service, I
request that you send a quick email to ddopson at gmail letting me know that
you used my code. I'll say, "Awesome! Can you tell me what it's going in?"  This
request is not legally binding (I can't / won't do anything if you ignore it).
BSD is pretty permissive, but if you need another license type, just ask.
I'm a big fan of the tounge-in-cheek WTFPL, but some lawyers told me that WTFPL
"doesn't have enough disclaimers". Lawyers. BSD has disclaimers. In case it's
still not obvious, no part of this paragraph is legally binding or alters the
formal (disclaimerish) text of the BSD license in any way. Cheers! --Dave
